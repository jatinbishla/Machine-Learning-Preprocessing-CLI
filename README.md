# Machine Learning Preprocessing CLI
The "Machine Learning Preprocessing CLI" project is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to simplify and automate the preprocessing stage of machine learning tasks. Preprocessing is an essential step in machine learning pipelines, involving the transformation and preparation of raw data before feeding it into a machine learning model.

The purpose of the "Machine Learning Preprocessing CLI" is to provide a user-friendly and efficient way to perform common preprocessing tasks without the need for extensive coding or manual intervention. It aims to streamline the data preprocessing process by offering a range of functionalities accessible through a command-line interface.

Some key features of the "Machine Learning Preprocessing CLI" may include:

Data cleaning: The CLI tool enables users to clean and handle missing or erroneous data by implementing techniques like data imputation, outlier detection, and handling duplicates.

Data transformation: It provides functionalities to transform the data into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms. This may involve feature scaling, normalization, one-hot encoding, or label encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical representations.

Feature selection: The CLI tool may include methods for automatic or manual feature selection, allowing users to choose relevant features and remove irrelevant or redundant ones to improve model performance.

Data splitting: It offers options for splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets, enabling users to set the desired proportions or apply specific sampling techniques like stratified sampling.

Data augmentation: In some cases, the CLI tool may provide techniques for data augmentation, which involves generating synthetic data points to increase the diversity and size of the training dataset.

Configurability and customization: The "Machine Learning Preprocessing CLI" may provide a range of configuration options and parameters, allowing users to tailor the preprocessing steps to their specific needs and requirements.

Overall, the goal of the "Machine Learning Preprocessing CLI" project is to simplify and automate the often complex and time-consuming process of preprocessing data for machine learning tasks. By providing a command-line interface with various preprocessing functionalities, it aims to empower users to prepare their data efficiently and effectively for subsequent machine learning modeling and analysis.
